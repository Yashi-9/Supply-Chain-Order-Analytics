#  Supply Chain Order Analytics | MySQL

###  Analyze order performance, cancellation trends, and supply chain KPIs using  MySQL.

---

##  Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world e-commerce supply chain analytics system. Using historical order and cancellation data, I developed a MySQL-based data solution to help business 

stakeholders understand:

* Order performance trends
* Cancellation rates (CAL) and root causes
* Product and region-level failure points
* Vendor and customer behavior insights

---

##  Dataset Used

> Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/annelee1/supply-chain-cel-dataset

* canceled_test.csv: Contains information on canceled orders.

 Columns: ORDER_NO, DATE, LINE, CUSTOMER_NO, ITEM, NC_ORDER, NC_SHIP

* sales_test.csv: Contains information on successfully fulfilled orders.

 Columns: ORDER_NO, DATE, LINE, CUSTOMER_NO, ITEM, NS_ORDER, NS_SHIP

---

## Database Schema

**Tables created**:

* `orders`: All delivered orders
  
* `cancellations`: Canceled orders 

Optional future expansions:

* `customers`, `products`, `vendors`, `inventory`

---


## Data cleaning

1. Changed the date format for both the tables

```sql

  ALTER TABLE orders ADD COLUMN proper_date DATE;
   
  SET SQL_SAFE_UPDATES = 0;

  UPDATE orders
  
  SET proper_date = STR_TO_DATE(TRIM(SUBSTRING(`DATE`, LOCATE(',', `DATE`) + 1)), '%M %d, %Y');

  ALTER TABLE orders DROP COLUMN `DATE`;

  ALTER TABLE orders CHANGE proper_date `DATE` DATE;
  
  ```
  
2 Finding Duplicates

```sql

WITH DUPLICATE AS (
    SELECT  *, 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (
            PARTITION BY ORDER_NO, LINE, DATE, CUSTOMER_NO 
            ORDER BY ORDER_NO DESC
        ) AS rn
    FROM 
        cancellations
)

SELECT  rn FROM  DUPLICATE WHERE   rn>1;

```

Results : No duplicates where found in both the tables.


## Key Business Metrics & Use Cases

* Monthly Order Volume helps track trends over time and identify seasonal patterns in customer demand.

* Cancellation Rate provides insight into the overall health of operations and can indicate issues with fulfillment or customer satisfaction.

* Most Canceled Categories highlight potential problems with specific products or vendors, helping to target improvements.

* Best-Selling Products are useful for demand forecasting, optimizing inventory, and guiding marketing and sales strategies.

###  ** Business Questions**

---

### 1. **How is the cancellation rate trending over time?**

**Business Understanding**: Trends in cancellation rates are crucial for understanding if operational or logistical issues are improving or worsening over time.

**SQL Query**:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(o.Date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month,
    COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) AS canceled_orders,
    COUNT(o.ORDER_NO) AS total_orders,
    ROUND(COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) * 100.0 / COUNT(o.ORDER_NO), 2) AS cal_percent
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN cancellations c ON o.ORDER_NO = c.ORDER_NO
GROUP BY order_month
ORDER BY order_month;
```

**Business Insight**: The **cancellation rate** has increased, it may indicate operational issues, stock shortages, or delays.

---


### 2. **Which products have the highest cancellation rates?**

**Business understanding**: Identifying products with high cancellation rates helps with product sourcing and understanding demand mismatch.

**SQL Query**:

```sql
SELECT 
    o.ITEM,
    COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) AS canceled_orders,
    COUNT(o.ORDER_NO) AS total_orders,
    ROUND(COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) * 100.0 / COUNT(o.ORDER_NO), 2) AS cal_percent
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN cancellations c ON o.ORDER_NO = c.ORDER_NO AND o.ITEM = c.ITEM
GROUP BY o.ITEM
ORDER BY cal_percent desc
LIMIT 10;

```

**Business Insight**: 

---

### 3. **Are cancellations more frequent in specific days ?**

**Business understanding**: Important for identifying operational or behavioral patterns.

```sql
SELECT 
    DAYNAME(o.DATE) AS order_day,
    COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) AS canceled_orders,
    COUNT(o.ORDER_NO) AS total_orders,
    ROUND(COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) * 100.0 / COUNT(o.ORDER_NO), 2) AS cal_percent
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN cancellations c 
    ON o.ORDER_NO = c.ORDER_NO
GROUP BY order_day
ORDER BY cal_percent DESC;
```

### 4. **Which customers have the highest cancellation rate?**

**Business Understanding**: Understanding high-risk customers can help prevent future cancellations by offering promotions, improving customer service, or adjusting inventory.

```sql
SELECT 
    o.CUSTOMER_NO,
    COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) AS canceled_orders,
    COUNT(o.ORDER_NO) AS total_orders,
    ROUND(COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) * 100.0 / COUNT(o.ORDER_NO), 2) AS cal_percent
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN cancellations c 
    ON o.ORDER_NO = c.ORDER_NO
GROUP BY o.CUSTOMER_NO
HAVING cal_percent > 10
ORDER BY cal_percent DESC
limit 10;

```

**Business Understanding** : Helps with inventory planning, promotion focus, and identifying popular products.

```sql

  SELECT 
    ITEM,
    SUM(NS_SHIP) AS total_units_sold
FROM orders

##  **SQL Views and Stored Procedures for Monthly KPIs**

### üßæ 1. SQL View: Monthly Order Volume

```sql
CREATE VIEW monthly_order_volume AS
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(DATE, '%Y-%m') AS order_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_NO) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_month
ORDER BY order_month;
```

> Use this view to report month-by-month trends in total order activity.
```
SELECT * FROM sales.monthly_order_volume;

```

---

### 2. SQL View: Monthly Cancellation Rate (CAL)

```sql
CREATE VIEW monthly_cancellation_rate AS
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(o.DATE, '%Y-%m') AS order_month,
    COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) AS canceled_orders,
    COUNT(o.ORDER_NO) AS total_orders,
    ROUND(COUNT(c.ORDER_NO) * 100.0 / COUNT(o.ORDER_NO), 2) AS cal_percent
FROM orders o
LEFT JOIN cancellations c ON o.ORDER_NO = c.ORDER_NO

### ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Stored Procedure: Get KPI Summary for a Specific Month

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE kpi_summary_by_month(IN input_month VARCHAR(7))
BEGIN
    DECLARE total_orders INT DEFAULT 0;
    DECLARE total_cancellations INT DEFAULT 0;

    -- Calculate total orders for the month
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT ORDER_NO)
    INTO total_orders
    FROM orders
    WHERE DATE_FORMAT(DATE, '%Y-%m') = input_month;

    -- Calculate total cancellations for the month
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT c.ORDER_NO)
    INTO total_cancellations
    FROM cancellations c
    JOIN orders o ON c.ORDER_NO = o.ORDER_NO
    WHERE DATE_FORMAT(o.DATE, '%Y-%m') = input_month;

    -- Final output
    SELECT 
        input_month AS month,
        total_orders,
        total_cancellations,
        ROUND(IFNULL(total_cancellations * 100.0 / NULLIF(total_orders, 0), 0), 2) AS cancellation_rate;
END //kpi_summary_by_monthkpi_summary_by_month

DELIMITER ;
```
~~~
call sales.kpi_summary_by_month('2017-01');

### 5.  Recommendation Summary for Management

*  Increase buffer inventory for top-canceled SKUs in East & North
*  Flag vendors linked to high cancellation rates for review
*  Focus on reliable brands with high order volume and low cancellations
*  Automate weekly KPI monitoring using views and stored procedures

---

## Future Improvements

* Normalize schema with separate `products`, `vendors`, `regions` tables
* Build live dashboards (Power BI / Tableau) from MySQL views
* Set up alerts for high cancellation spikes using triggers or Python scripts
* Use historical data to build predictive models (CAL forecasting)
